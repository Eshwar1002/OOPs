# OOPs
Here i have created various playbooks.

The playbook encompasses code implemented in the C++ programming language.

Most of the code snippets are embedded within comments, while a prominent title positioned above succinctly describes the purpose and content of the code.

Intro.cpp provides an overview of C++, covering essential topics such as headers, standard namespaces, and the main function.
